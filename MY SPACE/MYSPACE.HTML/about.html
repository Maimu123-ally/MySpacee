      <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
      <p>
        I am the 'little boy' who just wants to live his life peacefully with a 'hood person who loves him just as much as I love her'.
        Living each day as it comes with resilience, hope, and full of the laughter and love that I give.
        In life, I have simply wanted peace—and Maimunat is my peace 😊

      <h2>My Passions</h2>
      <p>
        I love God deeply, and music has a profound impact on me—especially Kanye West's music. It speaks to my soul.
        Music helps me reflect, feel, and connect with the world around me.

      <h2>My People</h2>
      <p>
        I’m lucky to have amazing people in my life. My best friends, Segun and Derin, are two of my favorite people in the world—right after my baby, of course.
        They keep me grounded, laughing, and sane through all of life’s ups and downs.

    <!-- Relationship Journey -->
    <section class="about-section">
      <h2>My Journey</h2>
      <p>
        You know what's wild? Finding that person who just gets you chuckling and goofling like you're kids again.
        It's like hitting the relationship jackpot — someone who doesn't just go through the motions but actually lights up your day.
        A wink or a nudge from them and suddenly, you're both in stitches, forgetting all the adulting that awaits you.
      </p>
      <p>
        But it's not just about the laughs and the playfights. It's also about those quiet moments when you're feeling down and they just get it.
        A little space — they give without making you feel lonely. Not saying much — they scoop you into a hug or let you vent.
        It's like they've tuned into your frequency, knowing exactly when to turn up the love.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's be real. It's one thing to say you want someone fun and flirty, but it's another to find someone who balances that with depth — someone who knows life isn't always sunshine and rainbows.
        Someone who sticks around for the stormy weather and doesn’t bail at the first sign of trouble.
      </p>
      <p>
        They say, “When you find that person who brings out your inner child, makes you laugh till your tummy hurts, and stands by you when you’re not at your best — hold onto them.
        It’s like finding a rare gem in a pile of stones. They make the whole crazy, mixed-up journey of life and love a bit more bearable, a bit more enjoyable.
        And at the end of the day, isn’t that what we’re all looking for?
        Someone to share the ride with, for all its twists and turns.”
